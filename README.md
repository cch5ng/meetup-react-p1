# Meetup Events

* [Work in Progress] Practice for forms
* Using React, ES6

## Running the Application

* Make a clone of this repo
* From the command prompt, navigate to the /build folder of the cloned repo
* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` (or an available port)
* Open http://localhost:8080 (or the port used)

## Reviewer Notes

* The main forms are at /app/components/Registration.jsx, and /app/components/Registration.jsx
* The events view is at /app/components/Events.jsx, and /app/components/Event.jsx
* I had difficulties running Chrome Vox with this application. I think there is some conflict with React application rendering.

## Comments/Concerns

* Please add a github issue. Thanks!
